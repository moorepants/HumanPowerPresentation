\note{From the dawn of humankind we have relied on human power to get things
done. Our bodies are amazing machines and for most of our history, the best
machines we had available to perform manual tasks. Our bodies have always been
used for transportation, they essentially evolved to move us about in a very
efficient manner. As, tools and machines began to arrive on the scene began the
search for the optimal use of our muscle power. }

    \begin{itemize}
        \item<1-> We are energy transformers!
        \item<2-> We digest our fuel (food) to supply our brain and muscles
            with the energy need to think and move.
        \item<3-> About as efficient as an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) (35\%)

    \end{center}
}
\note{In a way, we are simply another type of energy covnerter. We convert
energy from food to primarily mechanical energy. Some believe that the
evolution of us as a complex machine was simply to optimize our motion and
movement capabilities. But just as any energy conversion process, energy is
lost along the way. Human's are not especially fundamentally energy efficient,
so we have to think carafully aobut  how we maximize the efficiency of the work
we do?}

        \end{center}
	\end{beamerboxesrounded}
}
\note{Human bodies are built to transform energy. We covert food stuff to both
electrical and mechanical (maybe spiritual too) energy so that we can think and
compute and so that we can use our muscles to do work. There are two important
concepts that I want to reenforce from Physics 101 that aren't always
understood (I blame it partially on the energy companies confusing use of
kilowatt-hours). Work is a measure of energy and can simply be described as the
force times the distance it acts over. If I apply a force to this table and it
moves a certain distance, the product of those numbers is a measure of how much
energy is used to move the table. Power is how fast we do work, or work per
unit of time. If I take all day to push this desk across the room versus taking
30 secs, then the former takes much less power.}

\note{\small{So now that we are refreshed about work and power, I'd like to show you
one of my favorite graphs about human power output. This graph is generated
from series of experiments in which the person generates a fixed amount of
power until they are completely exhausted. On the X axis is time to exhaustion
on a non-linear scale. The Y axis is the power generated during the test. The
lowest curve is for a nominal healthy man and the curves and data points above
that are for various elite atheletes. I'm not sure were an average person from
a malnurished place may fall, but certainly below the healthy man line. Notice
the slope of the curves for durations under and hour and how steep they are.
To drive this graph home some let's see how long a heatly man can generate 200
watts of power (e.g. to power two 100 watt lightbulbs). He can last about 1
hour, until he is completely exhausted. But check out if we lower the power
output to 100 watts, the duration increases to about 5 hours. 100 watts is
about how much we expend when bicycling at an average commuting pace and is a
good expected maximum power output for many tasks. Keep in mind that these
experiments attempt to measure the raw power output of the humans, but that raw
power output has to be converted into some useful mechanical motion. Can anyone
guess how many people generating 100 watts would it take to power UC Davis's
electrical consumption? Something like 270,000 people.}}

}
\note{We all know that in the real world, there is always energy lost in
processes and we are on a constant mission to reduce these energy losses. This
is especially important when designing power extracting machines for humans,
due to the limited power they can generate. The efficiency of a process is the
output divided by the input. We almost always need the efficiency to be as high
as possible. It turns out that for human power generation, rowing and pedaling
are the most efficient methods of generating moderate to maximum power. They
both make use of our largest muscles, the legs and cyclic motions.}

\note{This table gives some idea of how efficient we are compared to other
systems. Human's are only 18 to 26 percent efficient in converting their food
to mechanical energy. An adult's nominal metabolic rate of energy consumption
is 100-150 watts. We're producing 3kW right here in the room, doing nothing.
The IC Engine is very similar in efficiency to a human and electrical motors
are pretty efficient. Keep in mind that efficiencies mutliply when you stack
devices. A human pedaling a generator through a transmission has an efficiency
from food to electricity of something like 15\%.}

\note{So how does this efficiency and power generation play out in the design
of human power harvesting machines? Take a look at these curves. The first is a
typical power versus pedaling rate for a cyclist. Notice that the maximum power
is produced somewhere around 85 rpm. Imagine that you want to have the person
generate electricity with a DC generator. The plot on the right shows the power
curve for a typical motor. The maximum power output here is around 1500 rpm.
And on top of that the most efficient rpm for the motor is around 2300 rpm. A
machine that couples the rider to the generator will have to be designed to
take all of this and more into account. First graph taken from Wilson2004 and

It is even more efficient than walking! Bicycles are the most abundant
transportation machine on the planet and they are utilitize in a multiude of
ways to move people and goods. The bicycle is a very valuable item in most of
the developing world. Many people think that an inexpensive and durable bicycle
can be a life saver for people in developing nations, allowing for better
commerce, kids getting to school, etc. There are an array of projects that are
trying to better lives with bicycles. But the bicycle is still a distant
commodity for many people as the price is not within reach. If anyone can
create a less than \$50 durable bicycle for the developing world, they will get
